# guessing-game
Programmed a very simple command-line guessing game in Python3.

Player gets to guess a number from a range of 1-9, till he decides to exit (by feeding 0).

Code checks if the player is correct or wrong, and if he's correct a point is added to score.

Either way a number of tries is incremented.

When he exits a ratio of 'correct guesses':'tries' is presented.



ENJ0Y THE G4ME =)
