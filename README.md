# guessing-game
Programmed a very simple command-line guessing game in Python3.

Player gets to guess a number from a range of 1-9, till he decides to exit (by feeding 0).
Code checks if the player is correct or wrong, and if the player is correct, a point is added to the score.
The number of tries is incremented after every try.
When player exits, a ratio of correct guesses & tries is presented.

Any suggestions or improvements are welcome.

ENJ0Y THE G4ME =)
